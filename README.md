# OuterSpace-

One page Repsonsive website. The theme of this website is outer space, as the name says. 
I made this page to test out how to make a page responsive & also mixed it with space because science is cool & the universe is pleasing to view.
My first every hosted website I made was based on a RPG game (can be see on my github), and that game is not responsive.

This project helped me learn more about the user interface as well as experience, a bit of design principles, and more about how to make a site responsive among all browsers like, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, etc.
